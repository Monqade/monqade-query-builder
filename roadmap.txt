QInput
  1) accept other/more arguments inteded for the underlying control. 
  https://material-ui.com/api/input/ has bunches of cool features
  disable, margin, multiline, color, autoFocus etc...
  should client code should/could passing arguments for that, QIndex
  should applie (material UI uses some technique for this)

  2) simply switch from Date/Number/Color etc - don't want
  to build control for each. How to test for this?
